## PART 1 : Configure the Branch Protection Rule 🛡️

We will configure GitHub to protect our `main` branch. This will make Pull Requests the _only_ way to get code into `main`.

---

1.  On your GitHub repository page, click the **`Settings`** tab.

2.  In the settings menu on the left, click on **`Branches`**.

3.  You should see a section named "Branch protection rules". Click the **`Add rule`** button.

4.  Name the **Ruleset Name** as you want

5.  Switch **Enforcement status** on **Active**

>     You can ignore Bypass list, it's to setup people who can bypass this rule.

6. Select **Add target** on the _Target branches_ module

- Chose 'include by patterns'
- Enter your default branch (here we use `main`)

7. This is the most important step: Check the box that says **Require a pull request before merging**.

   > This is the setting that will block our direct `git push` attempts.

<br>

8. Let the `Block forces pushes` box checked

9. **Optional** : Also check the box **`Require approvals`**. By default, it will be set to `1`. This means a PR can't be merged (even by its author) until _at least one other person_ reviews and approves it.

10. Scroll to the bottom and click the green **`Create`** button to save the rule.

Your `main` branch is now protected! Now, let's try to break it.

Now to merge on main you have to dev on an other branch, push it on origin and go on Github -> create a Pull Request -> merge it on `main`.
